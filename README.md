# Bebop

This website is my entry for the second installment of the WebJam.  

The WebJam is a kind of hacakton where people try to create websites with a theme and some rules including a time limit.
# Webjam Rules 
- Size: Any
- Theme: Movies
- Colors: In accordance with the tone of the movie
- Images: Any
- Javascript: Any
- Framework: Any

Create a single page/non-scrollable site for a movie of your choosing.
The site should work on any screen size and illustrate the the movie. It can be a recreation of an existing poster.

Text for the poster cannot be used as the only content for the page however. Both imaginary and real movies are accepted. Creativity is what's important.
